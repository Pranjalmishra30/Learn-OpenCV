## Directories and Branches
1. [OpenCV](https://github.com/Pranjalmishra30/openCV-Rep/tree/master/OpenCV) has all the main openCV codes. All the codes have been tested and are working.  
2. [Projects](https://github.com/Pranjalmishra30/openCV-Rep/tree/master/Projects) contains projects that i have completed in openCV. All of the projects are         accompanied with their own README file.
3. [Testing](https://github.com/Pranjalmishra30/openCV-Rep/tree/Testing) is the branch that contains the projects and topics that I am currently working on. The codes from there will be shifted to the OpenCV directory after they have been tested.

## Geneal protocol:  
   * This rep. is for testing and trying out new concepts.  
   * After the codes are tested , they can be pushed to the main Coding branch.
